## Let's play with CSS keyframe animations

Everyone would be feeling wondered when we see something moved with an animation. One of the best things about CSS is its ability to animate the components and make the visitors feeling wow. In today's article let's discuss one of the cool rules which specify the animation code in CSS. 

It's none other than ```@keyframes```. 

---

### Let's start with what is ```@keyframes```?

As discussed above, the ```@keyframes``` rule specifies the animation code.

The animation is created by gradually changing from one set of CSS styles to another.

During the animation, we can change the set of CSS styles many times.

Specify when the style change will happen in per cent or with the keywords ``` from``` and ``` to```, which is the same as 0% and 100%. 0% is the beginning of the animation, 100% is when the animation is complete.

### How to declare and use it? 

```
  @keyframes hide-and-show {
     0%   { opacity: 0; }
     100% { opacity: 1; }
  }
```
```
   #box {
      animation: hide-and-show 5s infinite;
   }
```

Every ```@keyframes``` statement needs a name. In this example, ```hide-and-show``` is the name of the animation.

As with the ```opacity``` property, animation requires a duration. Here we've said that the animation should last 5 seconds (5000ms) and it runs infinite time.

If an animation has the same starting and ending properties, one way to do that is to comma-separate the 0% and 100% values:

```
@keyframes fontbulger {
  0%, 100% {
    font-size: 20px;
  }
  50% {
    font-size: 16px;
  }
}
```

### Calling keyframe animation with separate properties

```
.box {
 animation-name: bounce;
 animation-duration: 4s; /* or: Xms */
 animation-iteration-count: 10;
 animation-direction: alternate; /* or: normal */
 animation-timing-function: ease-out; /* or: ease, ease-in, ease-in-out, linear, cubic-bezier(x1, y1, x2, y2) */
 animation-fill-mode: forwards; /* or: backwards, both, none */
 animation-delay: 2s; /* or: Xms */
}
```

### Animation Shorthand

Just space-separate all the individual values. The order doesnâ€™t matter except when using both duration and delay, they need to be in that order. In the example below 1s = duration, 2s = delay, 3 = iterations.

```
animation: test 1s 2s 3 alternate backwards
```

### 1. Multi-step animations

We can use percentages to allows us to add more than 2 steps.

```
 @keyframes hide-and-show {
    0% {
      font-size: 16px;
    }
    30% {
      font-size: 22px;
    }
    70% {
      font-size: 20px;
    }
    100% {
      font-size: 18px;
    }
 }
```

### 2. Combine transform and animation

```
 @keyframes rotate {
    from {
      transform: rotate(0deg);
    }
    to {
      transform: rotate(360deg);
    }
  }
```

### 3. Alternating animations

Let's suppose that we want an element to "breathe", inflating and deflating.

We could set it up as a 3-step animation:


![without.gif](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633361764297/QHmOk_ro0.gif)

Try out this example in  [codepen](https://codepen.io/ramyachinnadurai/pen/LYLovRJ) 

It spends the first half of the duration growing to be 1.5x its default size. Once it reaches that peak, it spends the second half shrinking back down to 1x.

This works, but there's a more elegant way to accomplish the same effect. We can use the animation-direction property:

![animation-direction.gif](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633365149371/Vqd0rDcCZ.gif)

Try out this example in  [codepen](https://codepen.io/ramyachinnadurai/pen/ExXzMqw)  

animation-direction controls the order of the sequence. The default value is normal, going from 0% to 100% over the course of the specified duration.

We can also set it to reverse. This will play the animation backwards, going from 100% to 0%.

### 4. Steps()

The steps() function controls exactly how many keyframes will render in the animation timeframe.
